This is a collection of scripts to use all conversion tools
for Kiel Corpus files in a nice way.

To use the XSLT-processor you will have to put the java archive
for Saxon-HE (saxonhe.jar) into

  ./kctei_stylesheets/lib/

Examples

Convert a Kiel Corpus file into KCTEI and all available
specific program formats
```
$ ./run_conversion_chain.sh data/g111a00l.s2
```
